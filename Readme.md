# TRHS CODE CLUB 

### What is this?

I run a programming club at my school. These are the projects I use to teach other people how to do stuff.

### Can I follow along?

Sure! This guide assumes a basic knowledge of C. You don't have to be a wizard at it, but basic stuff like ints and floats and functions should be familiar to you.

### Where do I start?

Our folders follow a naming scheme, which is class-$(num). Start with class-1, look at the presentation, and go from there.

### Is there video from this?

Probably. I'll include a link later if we do wind up having it.
